# 🧠 Insurance Customer Support Assistant (RAG + LangGraph)

> An intelligent customer support pipeline that uses **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to respond to insurance-related queries with document-grounded accuracy and smart agent routing.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project leverages a **modular AI-driven customer support system** built on top of:

- 🧭 **LangGraph**: For constructing dynamic, stateful agent workflows.
- 🧠 **LangChain**: To orchestrate prompt chaining, memory, and RAG capabilities.
- 📄 **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Uses real insurance PDFs for contextually accurate answers.
- 🔁 **LLM-agnostic design**: Works with both cloud models like **Gemini** and local models served via **LM Studio**.
- 🕸️ **Smart Routing**: Directs each query to its relevant domain-specific agent.

## 🧩 Features

### 🔍 Intelligent Categorization
Classifies customer queries into fine-grained insurance subcategories:


### 🤖 Agent-Based Workflow
Based on the query's **category** and **sentiment**, the system routes it to:

- `claims_agent`
- `renewal_agent`
- `premium_agent`
- `exclusions_agent`
- `coverage_agent`
- `handle_general` (fallback)
- `escalate` (if sentiment is negative)

### 📊 Sentiment-Aware Escalation
Escalates sensitive or dissatisfied user queries to human support.

### 🔗 RAG-Powered Accuracy
All domain answers are **backed by your company’s policy documents** using FAISS vector search.
